Dronova pioneers advanced autonomous meshed drone swarm technology for applications from disaster response to precision agriculture. Each drone, equipped with an embedded GPU and multiple sensors, forms a node in a mobile edge computing network. Our algorithms enable on-the-fly fine-tuning, allowing adaption to chaotic real-world contexts. Secure Bluetooth meshing enables swarm formation, allowing drones to share compute resources and use locally hosted vision models for rapid inference, eliminating the need for network connections. Swarm-level decision-making uses modified consensus algorithms optimized for specific tasks. Dronova's combination of real-time adaptation, distributed processing, and swarm intelligence pushes the boundaries of autonomous systems.
